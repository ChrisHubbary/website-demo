<p class="p7"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">It all began in McKinley High School during my sophomore year, November 2023. The weather was cloudy, and it was beginning to rain. That day was my first football game. I was in my dad’s big red truck and had just reached the school to grab my equipment. I felt overwhelmed because it was my first time playing an actual game.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">As soon as I entered the locker room, the stench hit me right in the face. I felt like I was going to die. I nearly had to hold my breath while walking in. I reached for my locker, put my belongings down, and grabbed my football equipment. One of the players I knew was already excited and prepared for the game. “Are you boys ready to win this game?” he yelled. Everyone was cheering and motivated, while I was the only one overwhelmed and hardly prepared.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">The coach walked into the locker room and told us we’d do a quick overview of the plays to see if we were ready. As soon as I walked back out, it was pouring rain. The bus had just arrived in time. We packed up our equipment and headed straight for it. The ride was a little long. A friend from my morning math class started blasting music to get us hyped up and motivated.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">A few minutes later, we reached our destination. We headed to another locker room they had prepared for us and started putting our equipment on. Coach came in with a straight face. He looked serious about the game. “Everyone ready?” he shouted. We said we were. Before heading out, he gave us a quick speech, then we prayed for everyone’s safety so no one would get hurt that night.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">We finished and lined up in the hallway in order, ready to walk out. Out of nowhere, I heard loud cheers and screaming from the crowd. They wanted a good game tonight. That’s when my stomach dropped. It felt like someone hit me so hard my soul left my body. My friend, who had also joined, looked over. “Are you feeling, okay?” he asked with concern. I gave him a thumbs up and lightly nodded.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">We scattered onto the field in order based on our numbers and started warming up. While warming up, it felt like all eyes were on me and my soul was being burned. Suddenly, I heard more cheers from behind me. The other team had arrived, and each one of them looked confident. The coach and referee checked our equipment to make sure everything was good. After that, we headed to the sideline for the first half to begin.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Ten minutes later, I heard the whistles blow. It was time to really get ready for this football game.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">The first half started. I saw three people walk up for the coin toss. They got the ball first. “Kickoff team, on the field!” the coach yelled. I was on that team, ready to go. Every step I took onto the field felt heavier, like I would trip over my own feet. We lined up, and the kicker shouted, “Macks, are you ready?” “Ready!” We all yelled back.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">The crowd was so loud I could barely think. The kicker raised his hand. Then came a loud boom as the ball soared down the field. The receiver caught it, and we all rushed down to tackle him. He went down, and that was it for the kickoff play.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">We ran back to the sideline, and I heard coach yell, “Defensive team, on the field!” My body was shaking so badly that I had to sit down. The way I felt reminded me of stepping onto a stage to sing at a talent show. I thought to myself, why did I even join the football team? Was it to make friends? To joke around? No. I had joined so I could be active after school, because my body was getting soft, and because I wanted to find the courage to face my anxiety.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">The more I thought about it, the more I realized the game itself wasn’t really the point. The plays, the cheers, even the score. None of that mattered as much as what happened inside me during that hour, I started out so nervous I could hardly breathe. My hands were shaking, my stomach was twisted, and I kept wondering why I had even joined the football in the first place. But by the time I stepped onto the field and felt the rain hitting my helmet, something changed. I was still scared, but I didn't let it stop me.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">That one hour taught me that fear doesn’t just disappear. You can’t wait for it to magically go away. The only way to deal with it is to step straight into it, even when your chest feels heavy and your legs feel weak. Every play I witnessed, every second I stayed out there, my confidence grew a little more. By the end of the half, I realized I had done what I thought I couldn’t, I had played, and I hadn’t fallen apart.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Football isn't just about winning games or making perfect plays. For me, it becomes something deeper. It was about proving to myself that I was capable of pushing past my own limitations. I didn’t completely defeat my anxiety that night, but I learned that courage doesn’t mean fear goes away. What courage means to me is, move forward even when you still feel scared, and event when it feels easier to walk away<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Looking back, that single hour of my life might not seem like much. But to me, it was proof that i could face my fears and come out stronger on the other side. And that lesson has stayed with me far beyond the field, shaping the way I handle challenges every day.</span></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p11"><span class="s1">During the football game, I really felt my stomach really drop to the floor and again, I thought it was a natural feeling. The people and the environment felt heavy to me and the main reason I feared was messing up. I was scared to get yelled at and wanted to prove myself useful to the team.</span></p>
<p class="p12"><span class="s1">At the end of my memoir, I thought to myself for a long time while sitting during the game and at the end of the game. I am still thinking about this moment till this day. I thought to myself, I joined the team because I wanted to meet new people and get stronger. But I joined to overcome the feeling I have felt, and I joined to overcome that feeling and the feeling was anxiety.</span></p>
<p class="p12"><span class="s1"> The main reason I wanted to share this story is because I want the person who is reading this to gain this information and there should be nothing wrong with what you’re feeling and become more confident in facing your fear. Everyone in this world always has the feeling of anxiety and it sometimes can be overwhelming to truly face it.</span></p>
